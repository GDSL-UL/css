## Overview

This repository contains the teaching materials, code and data used to support the course **Computational Social Science**. The course introduces students to the theoretical foundations, data sources and computational methods used to study human behaviour, social interactions and population processes at scale.

The materials combine social science theory with practical training in data analysis, statistical modelling, machine learning and spatial and network methods. They are designed for students from both social science and computational backgrounds who wish to develop applied skills for analysing contemporary social and population data.



## Background and provenance

This repository builds on earlier teaching materials developed for the course *Population Data Science*. The original materials were hosted at [https://github.com/fcorowe/r4ps](https://github.com/fcorowe/r4ps) and were designed by Prof Francisco Rowe, Dr Carmen Cabrera and Dr Elisabetta Pietrostefani.

The present repository represents a revised and expanded version of the course under the new title *Computational Social Science*. The previous version of the course remains available at:
